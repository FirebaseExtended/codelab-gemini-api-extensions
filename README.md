# Build AI-powered web apps with Gemini API Firebase Extensions

This is the code for [Build AI-powered web apps with Gemini API Firebase Extensions](https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/gemini-api-extensions-web) codelab.

## Getting started

First, replace `src/lib/firebase.config.js` with your own Firebase web app configuration.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the app by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/app/gallery/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
